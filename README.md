# .dotfiles

### Just a save of my linux configurations.
If this new setup, first run install_packages.sh

```
bash install_packages.sh
```


Then copy all the configuration files in the right directory using setup.sh

##### First run
```
./setup.sh --dry
```

This would show what the setup would remove and copy, if everything makes sense the run

```
./setup.sh
```
